**TODO:** \
[x] control node \
[x] local planning \
[x] localization node 

git submodule update --init --recursive --remote run this after cloning to make sure you clone the submodules

**Some details on what's going on:**
current repo - \
  perception - \
    listens to odom and publishes pose \
    odom comes from [https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_system](url) f1tenth_system repo \
    gets rid of speed attribute
    
  local planner - \
    ignores perception, takes odometry and global race line (not implemented yet) \
    finds point P on line closest to car \
    publishes waypoint of destination with starting point being P \
      does this via a radius and some linear algorithm
      
  control - \
    publishes speed and orientation to destination given waypoint \

how repo is being run - \
  launch file (maybe works?) will run every node and f1tenth_system repo


slam_toolbox repo ([https://github.com/SteveMacenski/slam_toolbox](url)) - \
  used for localization and mapping \
  runs localization at realtime \
  mapping done previously using teleop (map 1 lap around) \
  ran as a system package, but the node is separate \
  launch file will maybe run slam_toolbox too \


How to connect to car - 
  SSH via our IP address
    host f1tenth
    HostName 10.195.115.50
